**Pitch Perfect**

**Introduction**

Pitch Perfect is iOS app that allows users to record an audio clip and then play that audio clip with six different sound effects.

**Running Pitch Perfect**

To run Pitch Perfect a user simply needs to open the Pitch_Perfect.xcodeproj file in the Pitch Perfect project folder.  This file can be opened in Xcode.  Once the file is open the project can be run by building and running the project in Xcode.  

**Using Pitch Perfect**

**The Record Screen**

Pitch Perfect will open to the record screen on launch.  The record has two buttons: a record button and a stop button.  The record screen also has a text box between the two buttons.  Before recording begins the text box reads "Press to Record."  Once the user has pressed the record button the text box reads "Recording in Progress . . ."

Once the record button has been pressed the Stop button is enabled and the user can press the stop button to stop recording audio.  Once the stop button is pressed, the app will transition to the playback screen.  

**The Playback Screen**

On the playback screen there are six icons for various sound effects that can be applied to the recorded audio and there is also a stop button at the bottom of the Playback screen.  When one of the sound effects buttons is pressed the app will playback the audio with the correct sound effect.  Once playback begins, the stop button is enabled and the user can press the stop button to end playback.  Once playback begins all of the sound effect buttons are disabled until playback has completed.

The Playback screen also has a 'back' button at the top of the navigation bar.  When pressed, the back button will take the user back to the Record Screen.  

**Conclusion**

Thank you for trying out Pitch Perfect.  I hope you enjoy the app.
